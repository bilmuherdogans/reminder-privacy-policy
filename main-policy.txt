Privacy Policy – Reminder App
Effective Date: June 11, 2025
Contact: ibrahimerdogandev@gmail.com

This Privacy Policy explains how the Reminder – Task Manager & To-Do List application ("Reminder", "the app", "we", "our") collects, uses, stores, and protects your information. We are committed to maintaining your privacy and complying with Google Play policies and global data protection standards.

1. 📱 Data Collection
We do NOT collect any personal data.
All data (tasks, reminders, contacts, SMS templates) created by the user remains only on the local device.

No data is transmitted to any server or third party.

We do not require or store any login credentials.

The app works offline and does not rely on internet-based data exchange.

2. 🛡️ Data Storage and Protection
All task and reminder data is stored locally on your device using internal databases (e.g., SQLite, local file system).

No data is sent or synced to external services.

You, as the user, are fully in control of your data.

3. 📲 Use of SMS and Notifications
The app uses native Android APIs to send SMS and trigger notifications for reminders.

SMS is only sent when you explicitly configure it for yourself or your selected contacts.

We do not log, monitor, or store SMS content.

Notification permissions are only used for scheduled alerts and reminders.

4. 🧒 Children’s Privacy
Our app is not intended for users under the age of 13.
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe we have inadvertently collected data from a minor, please contact us at ibrahimerdogandev@gmail.com and we will promptly delete it.

5. 🔄 Third-Party Access
Reminder does not integrate with any third-party SDKs or services that track user behavior.
There are no external APIs, no analytics platforms, no ad networks, and no remote storage or databases involved.

6. ⚙️ Permissions Used
The app may request the following permissions, only for functional purposes:

SEND_SMS: To send reminders as SMS (if the user enables it).

RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED: To re-schedule reminders after device reboot.

FOREGROUND_SERVICE: To keep reminders running in the background.

NOTIFICATION ACCESS: To deliver scheduled alerts.

None of these permissions are used to collect data for analytics or advertising.

7. 🌐 International Users
Reminder is a multilingual app supporting RTL and LTR layouts.
However, all user data is still processed locally and never leaves your device, regardless of your country or region.

8. ⚠️ Timer System Disclaimer
The app uses system-level timers for reminders and SMS delivery. Due to limitations of certain Android devices or operating system versions, we cannot guarantee that reminders will always trigger exactly on time or only once.

Potential issues include:

Missed or delayed reminders after device restart

Battery optimization interfering with scheduled tasks

Multiple triggers for the same reminder

Notification suppression by OS settings

We are not liable for any missed events, duplicated notifications, or SMS delivery failures.

9. 🔄 Updates to this Policy
We may update this policy in the future.
Users will be notified through the app or app store listing if material changes are made.
